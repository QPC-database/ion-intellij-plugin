    <li>
        Complete refactor of the Amazon Ion plugin with V2 release. ðŸŽ‰
    </li>
    <li>
        Users with IntelliJ 2020.3+ can upgrade immediately by downloading and manually installing the JAR artifact which
        is built by the GitHub actions flow. A future revision will publish the plugin to the JetBrains repository which
        will allow users to download and install directly from the Plugin search menu in IntelliJ 2020.3+.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updated to use Java 11 to support newer versions of IntelliJ.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bad characters recovery in incorrectly formatted Ion has been improved by adding recovery statements in the BNF grammar.
    </li>
    <li>
        First comment line in an IonStruct is now indented properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        First IonStruct pair after a comment is now indented properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Space before and after colon in an IonStruct pair has been changed to only a space after the colon to
        closer match examples in the Ion Spec.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ion Expressions will be formatted in a single line if its considered a "short" expression, currently a single element.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comments after the first element in an Ion Expression will remain on the same line as the element.
    </li>
</ul>
